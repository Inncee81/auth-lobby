__UI for [auth.fission.codes](https://auth.fission.codes)__



## How does it work?

‚öóÔ∏è _This SPA allows you to:_

* Create a Fission account
* Link a Fission account from another device/browser
* Authorise an application


üîë _For each of those, you have to pass the required query parameters:_

* `did`, the did of the user on the domain you'll be redirect to
* `redirectTo`, the url the user will redirected to

You can define some optional parameters as well:
* `newUser`, `t` or `f`, if this parameter is given and the user has not signed in before, this will pre-select the appropriate screen for the user. If `newUser` is set to `t`, it'll show the create-account screen, and if set to `f`, it'll show the sign-in (aka. link) screen. If this parameter is not given at all, the user will be able to chose themselves.


üéí _When redirecting back it'll add the query params:_

* `newUser`, `t` or `f`, whether the user has just created an account or not
* `ucan`, a token authorising the application to perform actions
* `username`, the username that was chosen by the user

When the user decides to go back to the app for some reason (eg. not agreeing  
with the authorisation), the query parameter `cancelled=reason` will be added.

Possible cancellation reasons:
* `DENIED`, user chose to cancel the authorization
